-> Done - Game finishing handler.
-> Done- Add a moves counter and display it on screen.
-> Done - Remove Logger as Chrome suffices the purpose.
-> Done -Remove Enumeration (Oh really!! code)
-> Done Add a reset level button.
-> Done -- code needs some clean up..move undo part to a listener. and complete other refactoring/TODOs.
-> Done - Ctrl+Z short-cut for the undo button.
-> Done - Change grid...grid for each level is big say 50x50, main cells are in centre, the outside cells just form a boundary, this is required so that 
   the grid looks same for for each of the level.

-> Done - disable buttons (like next level, previous level, undo, reset) at appropriate times.
-> Done - show a pop-up LEVEL-COMPLETE at the centre of the screen with options like play-again, next-level, previous-level etc.
-> Done - CHROME WEB STORE: create the .crx file etc necessary to put the Game on the Web Store.
-> Done - Level chooser - A menu to choose to go to different level.(Kind of menu which we get in angry bird)
-> Done - Add ANT build file to automatically create the folder_Structure/zip files needed for the Chrome App.
-> Done (PARTIAL)- Add Storage, for a level -> best score, best time etc.
-> Done  Fallback for Storage - in case chrome.storage is not available, add a Fallback API, which just uses a HashTable or equivalent.
   (useful for testing in other browsers).
-> Done - Add a timer to clock the time spent on present level. It stops on completion of level.   
-> Done - Implement leader board for best score.
-> InProgress - Separate concerns  make the app more MVC compliant.

-> The storage.js is a mess. Remove the unnecessary functions storageAPIProvider and try to streamline StorageHelper.
-> User state storage methodology so that when user comes back , he should be able to play the level where he left instead of playing from the beginning.
-> Add upto 100 levels.

-> Add 'U' for undo along with Ctrl+Z.
-> Show Best score even in the Level Chooser.
-> Show help pop up window - give playing instructions.
-> leaderboard issue: leaderboard should be cleared as soon as new level is entered... then once we get the data from server populate the newer data.
-> leaderboard implementation : it is flawed... make the use of all data downloaded during startup.
